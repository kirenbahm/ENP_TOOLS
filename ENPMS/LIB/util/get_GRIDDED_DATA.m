function MAP_COMPUTED_GROUPS = get_GRIDDED_DATA(FILE_DFS, INI)

%---------------------------------------------
% FUNCTION DESCRIPTION:
%
% This function reads MIKESHE raw output files and saves
%   selected items into a .MATLAB file.
% The structures are stored in a map with station name as
% MAP KEY and computed data as MAP VALUE. The structure is accessed
% by providing the key as a character string e.g. D = MAP_ALL_DATA('NP205')

% Note dfs file has first timestep as 0 and matlab saves first timestep
% as 1

% note this script reads the items specified in the Excel sheet. If the
% number of items in the dfs output file changes, this script might be
% reading the wrong items. For example, if SZflow in the x-direction is
% item 1 in one file, and item 2 in another file, this script might pull
% the wrong data, if the Excel sheet item number was not changed.
% This will need to be fixed in future revisions of this function.

% the XL sheet requires 6 data items in the .dfs3 file,
% otherwise code breaks. This requires specific set up in
% the MIKE grid series output file. The variables could be:
% groundwater flow in x-direction
% groundwater flow in y-direction
% groundwater flux in z-direction for MIKE 2019: the other flux items i.e. x and y directions should be unchecked
% groundwater flow in z-direction for MIKE 2016 and 2017

% This code seems very inefficient, copying arrays of data multiple times,
% and looping over the same datasets multiple times.
% This is a good candidate for improvement, if you have the time!
